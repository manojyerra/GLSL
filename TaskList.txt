How to scale down the model ( This feature can have in 
How to avarage normals of obj.
How to load obj with meterial properties.
How to load obj other than triangulate faces.
Check tiny obj code.
Load stl file.
Load nastran file.

Check framebuffer issue with multisampling in desktop system which is working properly in my laptop.
Compare the particle demo output for the above.

Catche memory for geometry shader to improve performance.


OpenGL related tasks
--------------------
*) Work on wireframe.
*) Why one light is not working for PBR Shader ?
*) Add tranformation features in GLMeshRenderer class. Add initially uniform scaling, later check non-uniform scaling and how normals getting effected.
*) Allocate gpu memory only from GLMemory.
*) Blend issue
*) Need long as data type wherever allocating memory. Like GLBatch, GLMemory, GLBufferBuilder, Arrays 
*) While reading obj model data with scan line, we are reading it as float while scaning line, 
   but if the precision is more do we need to use double and in the opengl also do we need to use double ?
*) Think about zfighting properly with below questions. Precision depends on which things ?
   which things are constants for one vertex ?
*) Add camera options in UI for tweaking like ZNear, ZNearWidth and Camera paning and zoom.
*) Fix current camera issues zoom and pan issues.
*) Implement camera like First person shooter games.


SUI Related tasks
-----------------
*) Implement SUITextField erase functionality with left mouse.
*) SUITextField should work normally like other textfields.
*) Send all other inputs like scroll, left mouse, middle mouse to SUI.


Other
-----
*) Create release library for PNG
*) Make release build.
*) Add JSON reader/writer.


Done:
*)Remove all unneccessary include headers.
*)Remove windows specific code.
*)Rename GLMeshBuilder to GLBufferBuilder
*)Add phong per pixel shader with texture
*)Place ParticleLoader class in proper place. Seperate particle class opengl code and place it in Common/IO folder.
*)Have GeometryCubeShader class and have loading through GLMeshRenderer
*)Fix this waring "warning C4005: 'APIENTRY': macro redefinition"
