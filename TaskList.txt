Need for the release:
--------------------- 
*) Title should be as per module.
*) Apply transformation to carbody.
*) Drawing anode back faces with lighting.
*) Limit resizing of UIFrame to only vertical.
*) Add size limits to GLFW window.
*) Create TimelineBox as separate class and other UI will be in the ECoatPostProcessing as ECoatUI

Later:
------
*) Create GLFW window with GL_RGB pixel format.
*) Disable HDF5 chunking and check any performance improvement.
*) Implement loggers. Check in pega code or in the internet for better design.
*) Implement FBO and MSFBO by excluding UIFrame.
*) SSAO buffer and SSAO blur buffer type should be unsigned byte.
*) Default window y position should start from 0.
*) Take post processing senario like CarBody STL, Particle Data with positions, thickness,and check the memory allocation 
*) Remove all unneccessary include headers.
*) Remove windows specific code.
*) Remove the UIHud. [ Decision making pending ]
*) UIFrame width should be some percentage ( may be 20% to 25% ) of the main window. [ not suitable for SUI on all sizes. ]



Tasks for Integration
---------------------
*)Check for multisampled FBO support. Based on that decide enable/disable glfw window multi sampling.
*)Limiting of FPS.
*)Setup postprocessing project
*)Read tranformation values from HDF5 file and apply it on car model or particle data.
*)Project should run in linux
*)Why one light is not working for PBR Shader ?
*)Check framebuffer issue with multisampling in desktop system which is working properly in my laptop.
*)Taking screenshots and making video.
*)Pack below dll files.
*)Reset to origin and Zoom and Pan and rotate speed for camera.


OpenGL related tasks
--------------------
*) Add tranformation features in GLMeshRenderer class. Add initially uniform scaling, later check non-uniform scaling and how normals getting effected.
*) Need long as data type wherever allocating memory. Like GLBatch, GLMemory, GLBufferBuilder, Arrays 
*) While reading obj model data with scan line, we are reading it as float while scaning line, 
   but if the precision is more do we need to use double and in the opengl also do we need to use double ?
*) Think about zfighting properly with below questions. Precision depends on which things ?
   which things are constants for one vertex ?
*) Add camera options in UI for tweaking like ZNear, ZNearWidth and Camera paning and zoom.
*) Implement camera like First person shooter games.
*) Check how to save memory from SSAO buffers.


How to scale down the model.
How to avarage normals of obj.
How to load obj with meterial properties.
How to load obj other than triangulate faces.
Check tiny obj code.
Load nastran file.
Catche memory for geometry shader to improve performance.
Loggers implementation 


SUI Related tasks
-----------------
*) Implement SUITextField erase functionality with left mouse.
*) SUITextField should work normally like other textfields.
*) Send all other inputs like scroll, left mouse, middle mouse to SUI.


Other
-----
*) Create release library for PNG






Done:
-----
*)Rename GLMeshBuilder to GLBufferBuilder
*)Add phong per pixel shader with texture
*)Place ParticleLoader class in proper place. Seperate particle class opengl code and place it in Common/IO folder.
*)Have GeometryCubeShader class and have loading through GLMeshRenderer
*)Fix this waring "warning C4005: 'APIENTRY': macro redefinition"
*)Allocate gpu memory only from GLMemory.
*)Load stl file.
*) Add JSON reader/writer.
*) Fix current camera issues zoom and pan issues.
*) Work on wireframe.
*) Blend issue
*) Load HDF5 for loading contour and particle data.
*) Check the performance of HDF5 IO by adding cache memory like 3GB
*) Reduce multisampling to 6 and check render performance.
*) Have one variable for number of samples in GLFBOManager.
*) Remove glFinish() on deletion of gpu data.
*) NeedAllParticleRendering should be true on screen size change.
*) Check adding image filters for GLMSFBO gives any better quality ? ( no )
*) Create GLFBO and GLMSFBO with GL_RGB pixel format.
*) Use only one FBO for picking objects and picking the color of contours.
*) Check how much memory taking with WindowCreation, GLFBO, GLMSFBO. [max it will be 250 MB]
*) Limit FPS to 60.
*) UIFrame not updating based on onSizeChange.
*) Make release build.
*) Add Setting up the alpha value from all the shaders. (cross check it).
*) Remove maximize and close buttons from UIFrame.
*) Change focus color of UIFrame as text is not clearly visible.
*) Decrease the UIFrame box size.
*) Status
