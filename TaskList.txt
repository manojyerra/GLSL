How to avarage normals of obj.
How to load obj with meterial properties.
How to load obj other than triangulate faces.
Check tiny obj code.
Load stl file.
Load nastran file.
Check framebuffer issue with multisampling in desktop system which is working properly in my laptop.
Compare the particle demo output for the above.
Fix camera issues.
Add camera options in UI for tweaking like ZNear, ZNearWidth and Camera paning and zoom.
Catche memory for geometry shader to improve performance.
Make release build.

Think about zfighting properly with below questions.
Precision depends on which things ?
which things are constants for one vertex ?

Implement SUITextField erase functionality with left mouse.
SUITextField should work normally as other textfields.
Send all other inputs like scroll, left mouse, middle mouse to SUI.



Code refactoring.

*)Install Resharper
*)Remove all unneccessary include headers.
*)Place ParticleLoader class in proper place. Seperate particle class opengl code and place it in Common/IO folder.
*)Have GeometryCubeShader class and have loading through GLMeshRenderer
*)Rename GLMeshBuilder to GLBufferBuilder
*)Fix warnings
